# Financial Bank Loan Data-Analysis  (Interactive Dashboard Using Power Bi)

## Interactive dashboards and analysis to monitor loan portfolio KPIs, identify risk pockets, and drive data-backed lending decisions.

## Project Summary
This project builds a comprehensive **Bank Loan Report** with three dashboard pages: **Summary**, **Overview**, and **Details**. The dashboards visualize key lending metrics, monthly trends, geographic distribution, loan-term distribution, loan-purpose breakdown, employment-length impact, home-ownership analysis, and a detailed grid for transactional review. The goal is to monitor portfolio health, identify risk pockets, and recommend data-driven actions.
